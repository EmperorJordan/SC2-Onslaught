SC2-Onslaught
=============

====================
What is "Onslaught"?
====================

The concept of the map is fairly straight forward:  It's a take off of unreal
tournament's "Onslaught" mode which debuted in UT 2004.

In Onslaught, the idea is that there are two teams with a single goal:  To
destroy the enemy base's power core.  While simple, there are a few mechanics
and twists to this.  First, you can't just waltz into the enemy base and blow
it up because its invulnerable to start, and the enemy team would likely
obliterate you.

So how do you accomplish the goal of destroying the enemy power core?

This is where the fundamental concept of Onslaught comes in.  There are
"nodes" on the map that you can capture, and the idea is if you can "connect
the nodes" from your base to the enemy base then their power core will become
"vulnerable" at which point you can proceed to destroy it.

A power node is *only* active iff it has a link (either directly or through
a path of connected nodes) to a base.  If it becomes disconnected, it is no
longer active and must be reconnected.

To make things interesting, the only way you can attack an enemy power node
is if you have a path of nodes leading to it!  This leads to interesting
gameplay tactics.

So where does SC2 Onslaught come into play?  Well, I'm heavily basing it off
of Unreal Onslaught which was just discussed so the core mechanics WILL stay
the same; that is there will be two bases, each with the goal of destroying
the other base's power core, and nodes on the map to connect to accomplish
this.

The following is a list of unique gameplay mechanics I will be adding in
addition to the core Onslaught ones:

- Power nodes will feature an "Expo" (one or more) which will encourage 
the teams to fight over them.

- In-game leaderboards, so you can see how each player is performing (kills,
power node captures, resources, etc).
